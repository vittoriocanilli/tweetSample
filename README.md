Command line script to output tweets

Here is a small PHP script that runs on the command line and outputs tweets to the standard output.

Please find the documentation at

https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/statuses/sample

The script should understand four input parameters:

• n: Exit after n tweets were outputted.
• t: Exit after t seconds (doesn‘t has to be exact).
• Default values are 0, run indefinitely.
• The output should contain the username and the text of the tweet.
